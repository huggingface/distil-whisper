## STREAM WHISPER

Well, I figured out distil-whisper would work better with stream capabilities, i.e ability to transcribe videos/audios from not just file paths, but also links/urls. So, stream-whisper was born.

In case you still haven't figured, stream whisper is a fork of huggingface's distil whisper that is fundamentally a fast speech recognition and transcribing engine.

## USAGE

1. Clone or download this repository
2. install the requirements with pip
3. run stream-whisper.py
4. optionally, setup your variables in settings file.

N.B: The original README.md of distil whisper is here.
